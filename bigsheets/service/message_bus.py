    """A message bus using the message broker pattern for an event
    driven system.

    Receives messages (events and commands) and executes them through
    previously registered handlers.

    Events are sent to multiple event handlers (listeners)
    asynchronously, and each handler fails independently.

    Commands are sent to one command handler (listener) synchronously,
    so the caller blocks and gets the result of the handler, as when
    executing a regular function.
